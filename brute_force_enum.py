def brute_force_password(candidate_password):
    """
    Function to perform brute-force password testing.

    Args:
        candidate_password (str): The password to test.

    This function is designed to test each candidate_password against a target
    system to determine if it is the correct password. In a real-world scenario,
    this function would include logic to interact with the target system.

    Example:
        brute_force_password("abc1")  # Testing password "abc1"
    """
    print(f"Trying password: {candidate_password}")

def threaded_brute_force_passwords():
    """
    Function to perform threaded brute-force password testing.

    This function generates all possible passwords of a specified length using
    characters from a specified character set (string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits).
    Each generated password is tested concurrently using threads.

    Example:
        threaded_brute_force_passwords()  # Starts threaded password testing
    """
    threads = []
    password_length = 4  # Set the desired password length
    charset = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits  # Use the desired character set
